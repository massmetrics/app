        <div class="instructions h4">In order to track a product you must create an account by clicking the register
          link at the top of the page, entering your email and password, and clicking register(Don't worry, we wont send
          you any emails you don't specifically request.) Once you have registered, you can click the
          "Track-it" button on any product on the site. You will then be brought to the "My Products" page where you
          will see a list of all of the products you have chosen to track.  On the "My Products" page, you can set and remove
          notifications for products, or choose to un-track products.  If you wish to track a product, but you do not see a
          "Track-it" button, you are likely already tracking the product on the "My Products" page.

        <div class="instructions h4">You can receive a notification for a tracked product by setting
          a "Target discount" on the "My Products" page. When the Current discount reaches the Target discount, an email
          will be sent to the email you registered your account with. Mass Metrics will send no more than one email per
          week per product and no more than one email per day.  A reminder email will be sent once per week until you
          remove the notification or the products discount is not more than the target discount.

          suggest it by clicking the "Suggest a product" tab. Simply get the sku from the url on the amazon product
          page(pictured) and enter it in the "Enter SKU from Amazon" field. You can also suggest categories for the product by
          entering them in the "Enter a Category" field.  Multiple categories can be suggested by separating each category
          with a comma as pictured.  Products can only be suggested one at a time and all products are subject to review
          prior to being added in order to maintain the integrity of the product collection.
